      <h3>A New Discovery</h3>
      <img src="stonecircle.jpg" alt="Bronze Age Stone Circle">
      <p>Archaeologists have discovered that what was thought to be a single standing stone in a forest is actually part of a larger ceremonial site dating back 3,700 years to the Bronze Age.</p>

      <p>The discovery was made in Farley Wood, near Matlock in Derbyshire, following excavations by Forestry England in partnership with the archaeology team from the TV series <em>Time Team</em>.</p>

      <p>Local archaeology enthusiast George Bird had suspected for some time that the stone might be part of a larger monument. His insights led to the investigation and subsequent discovery of several other stones forming a circle.</p>

      <p>Forestry England stated they would now treat the site with the same protections as a scheduled monument to preserve its historical significance for future generations.</p>
