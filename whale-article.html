      <h2>Entangled Whale Dies on Beach</h2>
      <h3>What Happened in Scotland?</h3>
      <img src="whale.jpg" alt="Stranded Whale">
      <p>A sperm whale which died on Monday after washing up on the island of Raasay had been entangled in ropes. It was the latest in a series of whale entanglements off the Scottish coast in the last few months.</p>

      <p>The 15m-long (49ft) sperm whale was spotted off Skye last Thursday. It was entangled in ropes, some of them trailing up to 20m (66ft) behind it. Attempts to rescue it were unsuccessful due to weather conditions and safety concerns.</p>

      <p>Marine experts believe the whale was likely weakened by its entanglement, which made it vulnerable and disoriented. It eventually washed ashore and died shortly after.</p>

      <h3>Can Entanglements Be Prevented?</h3>
      <p>The Entanglement Alliance has been working with the inshore fishing industry to raise awareness. It encourages people in the industry to report incidents and participate in disentanglement training workshops. Conservationists continue to push for safer fishing gear and stricter policies to reduce whale entanglements in the future.</p>
